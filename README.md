# Hannukah of Data: 2022 [5783]

These are my solutions in [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for Hannukah of
Data 2022.

I attempted for most of my answers to be as single execution as possible.
Leveraging [`pd.DataFrame.pipe`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pipe.html)
as much as possible to resemble R and/or SQL.

Thanks to [saulpw](https://www.saul.pw/) and the [Devottys](https://github.com/devottys)
for these amazing puzzles.
